# KMeans Clustering Task

## Overview
This repository implements the **KMeans Clustering** algorithm to segment a dataset into distinct clusters. The task involves data preprocessing, fitting the model, and evaluating the clustering performance using metrics like the **Silhouette Score** and **Inertia**.

## Project Contents
- **Dataset**: A dataset containing features for clustering into different groups.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of the **KMeans Clustering** algorithm for unsupervised learning.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating clustering performance using metrics like **Silhouette Score**, **Inertia**, and visualization of clusters.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
